Hi Gaston, Naming Convention and Framing query look perfect. There are a few changes to be made. 

1. Please look at the columns joined for the tables Property and OwnerProperty. 
2. Calculate the Yield. (That's not the exactly calculated column if you cross-check it doesn't satisfy). {[ Sum of payments -sum of expenses]/[Homevalue]}*100. 
3. Giving alias names looks good. Example : p.[Name] AS PropertyName. 
4.For the part of the report, have you given hardcoded values for the current owner as ABCD and so on? 


Regards, Vishrutha.



Hello Vishrutha

1. I've Fixed the columns joined
2. I calculated the yield with the formula that you gave to me.
3. I assigned proper name to the columns.
4. I've attached a picture with the design tab. The Current owner and the other rows I created Text boxes. For the Table I created a DB.

Thank you!
